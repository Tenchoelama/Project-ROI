## Project-ROI

### Goal:

##### Build a program that allows users to manage their ROI calculations and make adjustments as needed.

### Process: 

##### -This is a Python code for a class called "ROI" that contains methods to calculate, edit and display the return on investment (ROI) for a property.

##### -The class has the following attributes: name, expense, revenue, investment, r_o_i, d_exp, and d_rev.

##### -The "calculator" method calculates the ROI based on the revenue, expenses, and initial investment provided by the user.

##### -The "user_input" method prompts the user to input the revenue, expenses, and initial investment for the property.

##### -The "edit_expense" method allows the user to add or remove expenses for the property and updates the expense attribute accordingly.

##### -The "edit_revenue" method allows the user to add or remove revenue for the property and updates the revenue attribute accordingly.

##### -The "display" method displays the summary of the ROI for the property including the name, total expenses, total revenue, and the ROI calculated by the "calculator" method.

##### -The "Main" class contains a method called "run" that creates an instance of the ROI class and prompts the user to choose from the options to calculate, display, edit expenses, edit revenue or exit.
